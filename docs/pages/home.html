  <p>Welcome to my dashboard!</p>
  <p>I made up a bunch of heuristic nonsense to help me win in fantasy, and it's led to a 1st and 2nd place finish in the years I've used it. It is focused on hard contact from hitters (and so it may disproportionately rag on guys like Luis Arraez), and all-around pitcher profiles with an emphasis on swing-and-miss.</p>
  <p>Aside from making the dashboard itself, I've also ventured into the prospect world in 2026! That and the dubiousness of spring stats.</p>
